MrFrog: Oh, traveler! Finally!
MrFrog: I thought our hopes had sunk into the swamp... 
Allow me to introduce myself —  I am Froggleton, elder of this island. 
MrFrog: Once, this place was a blooming paradise, but now... now only the rattling of bones fills the night.
MrFrog: The skeletons... they came out of nowhere, like shadows cast by a vanished sun.
MrFrog: But you... you look strong, brave! Your arrival must be a sign that even in the darkest hour, there’s a glimmer of hope.
MrFrog: Please, help us! Rid our island of these cursed creatures, and we will reward you with all we can offer.
MrFrog: So, what do you say? Adventure calls!
- Do I have a choice?..
	MrFrog: No \:3
	- Sure...
- Sure, let me help you!
